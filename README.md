# Wordle_Clone
Shamelessly made a clone of Wordle. Props to original creator over [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

## Coding Concepts
- My first foray into using Pygame!
- Included some flexibility in using external text files: puzzle.txt containing possible secret words and allowed.txt containing all other acceptable words
- The rest is string manipulation and managing the display, along with using a dictionary to keep track of colors to use for the letters 
- Update: Version 3 now includes mouse support and displays some stats in terms of win rate as well as average number of tries taken

## Notes
Special thanks to Tech With Tim's pygame [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY&t=454s)!
